									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/mack_grimsley.jpg" alt="" /></span>Welcome and Thank you for visiting MG3 Ministry! Mack V Grimsley is the Visionary and Founder of this Faith-based Organization designed and dedicated to nurturing spiritual growth and empowering individuals to transform their lives primarily through God’s Word and by Faith application.</p>
									<p>MG3 operations are served through multiple platforms as it efficiently fulfills its Kingdom mission and various Business services by providing “Strategies 2 Victory, Achieving 1’s Destiny!” Mack was born and raised in Newark, NJ to Mack and Betty Grimsley and grew up in church where his Father Pastored. He attended West Side High school and Upsala College. He pursued religious studies at Evangelical Bible Institute in NJ and The Evangelical Training Association where he became a Certified Approved Bible Teacher. He also studied Theology at St Peters University of Jersey City. 
									</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/cover_photo.jpg" alt="" /></span>Mack began serving in the Ministry in 1991 as a Youth Minister at his home church, Gospel Tabernacle. He later became an Ordained Elder in 1996 under the P.A.C. and then installed as Pastor of The S.T.O.N.E. (Strong Tower Of North Ekklesia) in 2006.
									</p>
									<p>Pastor Mack is a Writer and Content Creator. He authored and published his first book entitled, God’s Purpose Is Greater Than Your Pain! The Brand Name “MG3” is derived from his grandfather's first name Mack, who then named his son Mack. And now Mack named his son Mack IV.</p>
									<p>During the midst of the Pandemic, as Mack was Counseling and helping many who were emotionally affected and suffered tremendous loss, he enrolled in Light University to enhance his Counseling skills and become more knowledgeable of the Mental Health crisis. He then graduated in September 2023 as a Certified Mental Health Coach. MG3 Ministry provides Counsel, Therapy and Coaching services in:
										<ul>
											<li>Pastoral/Spiritual Counseling</li>
											<li>Relational/Marital</li>
											<li>Individual</li>
											<li>Mental Health</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								
									<p>Mack has also become an Entrepreneur, launching his own brand in merchandise and apparel entitled, “Text and Tweet the Lord is Good!” This Trademark slogan provides a light and opportunity to witness and invite the world to come and know Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior through the Bible verse of “Taste and See the Lord is Good!” (Psalms 34:8)
									</p>

									<p>You can tune in weekly to listen to and livestream Mack’s radio broadcast on WPAT 930 in NY City every Wednesday from 4:30 - 5pm EST.
